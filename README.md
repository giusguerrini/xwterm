**Simple web X and ANSI terminal emulator - pure JavaScrpt, no dependencies**   

## Note
The goal of this project is to provide a simple, pure javascript terminal emulator frontend (i.e., the client side). Connecting ot to a terminal service is a user's job. For testing purtposes, a very basic terminal server is available here.
This project is still work-in-progress.
